1. Purpose and Focus:
Terraform:

Purpose: Infrastructure provisioning and management across multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments.
Focus: Declarative provisioning and orchestration of resources.
Ansible:

Purpose: Automation of configuration management, application deployment, and infrastructure tasks.
Focus: Agentless, task-based automation for configuration and deployment.
AWS CloudFormation (CFT):

Purpose: Infrastructure provisioning specifically for AWS.
Focus: Declarative provisioning of AWS resources using JSON or YAML templates.
2. Syntax and Configuration:
Terraform:

Syntax: HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
Configuration: Declarative.
Ansible:

Syntax: YAML.
Configuration: Declarative (with some imperative aspects).
AWS CloudFormation (CFT):

Syntax: JSON or YAML.
Configuration: Declarative.
3. Multi-Cloud Support:
Terraform:

Multi-Cloud: Yes, supports multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments.
Ansible:

Multi-Cloud: Yes, supports multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments.
AWS CloudFormation (CFT):

Multi-Cloud: No, primarily focused on AWS.
4. Agent vs. Agentless:
Terraform:

Agent: Agentless.
Ansible:

Agent: Agentless.
AWS CloudFormation (CFT):

Agent: N/A (Does not use agents; it's a service provided by AWS).
5. Configuration Management:
Terraform:

Configuration Management: Limited; primary focus is on provisioning infrastructure.
Ansible:

Configuration Management: Yes, strong focus on configuration management and automation.
AWS CloudFormation (CFT):

Configuration Management: Limited; primarily used for infrastructure provisioning.
6. Ease of Use:
Terraform:

Ease of Use: Generally considered easy to learn and use.
Ansible:

Ease of Use: Generally considered easy to learn and use.
AWS CloudFormation (CFT):

Ease of Use: May have a steeper learning curve; syntax can be verbose.
7. Community and Ecosystem:
Terraform:

Community: Large and active community.
Ecosystem: Supports a wide range of providers; HashiCorp Terraform Registry for modules.
Ansible:

Community: Large and active community.
Ecosystem: Extensive collection of modules; Ansible Galaxy for sharing roles.
AWS CloudFormation (CFT):

Community: AWS-centric community.
Ecosystem: AWS CloudFormation Registry for pre-built templates.
8. Use Cases:
Terraform:

Use Cases: Multi-cloud provisioning, infrastructure as code.
Ansible:

Use Cases: Configuration management, application deployment, automation.
AWS CloudFormation (CFT):

Use Cases: AWS-specific infrastructure provisioning.
9. Updates and Changes:
Terraform:

Updates: Incremental updates; Terraform plans show changes before applying.
Ansible:

Updates: Idempotent tasks; changes can be previewed.
AWS CloudFormation (CFT):

Updates: Stack updates; changes are defined in the template.
Conclusion:
Choose Terraform if you need multi-cloud support and want to focus on infrastructure provisioning and orchestration.

Choose Ansible if you want agentless, task-based automation with strong configuration management capabilities.

Choose AWS CloudFormation if you are specifically working within the AWS ecosystem and want a native solution for infrastructure provisioning.
